# Tilemap Studio [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rangi42/tilemap-studio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rangi42/tilemap-studio)

A tilemap editor for Game Boy, GBC, GBA, or SNES projects. Specifically meant to support the [pret](https://github.com/pret) disassemblies like [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered), [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal), and [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald); as well as hacks including [Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal), [Red++](https://github.com/TheFakeMateo/RedPlusPlus), [Orange](https://github.com/PiaCarrot/pokeorange), [Prism](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonPrism), and many more.

Inspired by tools like [Tilemap Creator](https://github.com/erandis-vol/Tilemap-Creator), [NTME](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=149454), [GSC Town Map Editor](https://hax.iimarckus.org/topic/97/) and [Karteneditor](https://i.imgur.com/70jDfdM.png), but implemented with C++ and [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/), and with support for multi-platform tilemaps as well as Pokémon-specific formats.

Latest release: [**3.2.0**](https://github.com/Rangi42/tilemap-studio/releases/tag/v3.2.0)

Follow the steps in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install the release copy of Tilemap Studio, or the longer instructions to build it yourself from source.

The [example/](example/) directory contains different formats of tilemaps and tileset graphics. In particular, [pokecrystal/town_map_pokegear.png](example/pokecrystal/town_map_pokegear.png) is a colored-in combination of tileset graphics from [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal), useful for viewing any Town Map in a project based on it.
