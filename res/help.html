<p>)" PROGRAM_NAME R"( displays and edits tilemap files. (There's no standard extension for those; some are .tilemap, .map, .bin, .raw, or others.) It supports all the standard ways to open a file:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Initial:</b> Double-click a .tilemap file in File Explorer. (Run install.bat to associate .tilemap files with )" PROGRAM_NAME R"(.)</li>
<li><b>Menu bar:</b> Run )" PROGRAM_EXE R"( and select the Tilemap&nbsp;→&nbsp;Open… menu item.</li>
<li><b>Toolbar:</b> Run )" PROGRAM_EXE R"( and click the Open toolbar button.</li>
<li><b>Keyboard:</b> Run )" PROGRAM_EXE R"( and press )" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(O.</li>
<li><b>File Explorer:</b> Drag a .tilemap file onto )" PROGRAM_EXE R"(.</li>
<li><b>GUI:</b> Drag a .tilemap file onto the tilemap canvas (right) of an open )" PROGRAM_NAME R"( window. You can also drag a tileset image file onto the tileset array (left) to load its graphics.</li>
<li><b>Command Prompt:</b> Pass the .tilemap filename (and optionally a tileset filename too) as an argument to )" PROGRAM_EXE R"(:<br><font size="2"><kbd>)" PROGRAM_EXE " gfx" DIR_SEP "pokegear" DIR_SEP "johto.bin gfx" DIR_SEP "pokegear" DIR_SEP R"(town_map.png</kbd></font><br>You can also pass the name of an importable file (.c, .asm/.inc, .csv, or .rmp) to import it, or an image file (.png, .bmp, or .gif) to start Image to Tiles with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a tilemap is opened, it asks for the format. The available formats are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Plain tiles:</b> Each byte is a tile ID, top to bottom, left to right. A byte has eight bits and goes from $00 (0) to $FF (255), so there are 256 possible tiles.</li>
<li><b>GBC tiles + attributes:</b> Bytes come in pairs: a tile ID and an attribute byte. The bits of the attribute byte encode the tile bank (effectively allowing 9-bit tile IDs, or 512 possible tiles), a choice of eight palettes (each with four colors), X/Y flip, priority, and OAM1. (More on what those mean later.)</li>
<li><b>GBC tilemap + attrmap:</b> The tilemap file itself just has plain tile IDs, but a corresponding attrmap file has the attribute bytes.</li>
<li><b>GBA tiles + 4bpp palettes:</b> Bytes come in pairs, encoding 10-bit tile IDs (so up to 1,024 possible tiles), a choice of 16 palettes (each with 16 colors), and X/Y flip.</li>
<li><b>GBA tiles + 8bpp palette:</b> Bytes come in pairs, encoding 10-bit tile IDs (so up to 1,024 possible tiles) and X/Y flip. All tiles are assumed to use a single palette with 256 colors.</li>
<li><b>NDS tiles + 4bpp palettes:</b> This is the NSCR/RCSN format supported by <a href="https://github.com/pleonex/tinke">Tinke</a>. After a $24-byte header, bytes come in pairs, encoding 10-bit tile IDs (so up to 1,024 possible tiles), a choice of 16 palettes (each with 16 colors), and X/Y flip.</li>
<li><b>NDS tiles + 8bpp palettes:</b> This is the NSCR/RCSN format. After a $24-byte header, bytes come in pairs, encoding 10-bit tile IDs (so up to 1,024 possible tiles) and X/Y flip. All tiles are assumed to use a single palette with 256 colors.</li>
<li><b>SGB border:</b> Bytes come in pairs: a tile ID and an attribute byte. The only supported attribute bits are a choice of four palettes (each with four colors) and X/Y flip.</li>
<li><b>SNES tiles + attributes:</b> Bytes come in pairs, encoding 10-bit tile IDs (so up to 1,024 possible tiles), a choice of eight palettes (each with 16 colors), X/Y flip, and priority.</li>
<li><b>Genesis tiles + attributes:</b> Bytes come in pairs, encoding 11-bit tile IDs (so up to 2,048 possible tiles), a choice of four palettes (each with 16 colors), X/Y flip, and priority.</li>
<li><b>TG16 tiles + palettes:</b> Bytes come in pairs, encoding 11-bit tile IDs (so up to 2,048 possible tiles) and a choice of 16 palettes (each with 16 colors).</li>
<li><b>RBY Town Map:</b> A sequence of bytes that each encode a tile ID in their high nybble and a run length in their low nybble, ended by a $00 byte. For example, $46 encodes a sequence of six tiles with ID $04. Only 16 tile IDs can be represented, $00 to $0F. Meant for the Town Map tilemap in pokered: gfx)" DIR_SEP R"(town_map.rle.</li>
<li><b>GSC Town Map:</b> A sequence of tile IDs ended by an $FF byte (so $FF is not a valid tile ID). Meant for the Town Map tilemaps in pokecrystal: gfx)" DIR_SEP "pokegear" DIR_SEP R"(johto.bin and kanto.bin.</li>
<li><b>PC Town Map:</b> A sequence of bytes that each encode a tile ID in their low six bits and X/Y flip attributes in their high two bits, ended by an $FF byte. Only 64 tile IDs can be represented, $00 to $3F. Meant for the Town Map tilemaps in <a href="https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal">Polished Crystal</a>: gfx)" DIR_SEP "town_map" DIR_SEP R"(*.bin.</li>
<li><b>SW Town Map:</b> A sequence of tile IDs and run lengths, ended by a $00 byte (so $00 is not a valid tile ID). For example, $0F $06 encodes a sequence of 6 tiles with ID $0F. Meant for the Town Map tilemap in pokegold-spaceworld: gfx)" DIR_SEP "trainer_gear" DIR_SEP R"(town_map.tilemap.rle.</li>
<li><b>Pok&eacute;gear card:</b> A sequence of tile IDs and run lengths, ended by an $FF byte (so $FF is not a valid tile ID). For example, $F0 $0D encodes a sequence of 13 tiles with ID $F0. Meant for the Pok&eacute;gear card tilemaps in pokecrystal: gfx)" DIR_SEP "pokegear" DIR_SEP R"(*.tilemap.rle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most functions are available via the menu bar, the toolbar, or shortcut keys.</p>
<p>The tilemap canvas (on the right) and tileset array (on the left) use the mouse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click a tile in the tileset array to select it.</li>
<li>Left-click and drag in the tileset array to select a rectangle of tiles.</li>
<li>Left-click or drag in the tilemap canvas to place the selected tile.</li>
<li>Right-click a tile in the tileset array to highlight every use of it in the tilemap. Right-click it again to un-highlight.</li>
<li>Right-click a tile in the tilemap canvas to select it in the tileset.</li>
<li>Right-click and drag in the tilemap canvas to select a rectangle of tiles.</li>
<li>Middle-click and drag to scroll the tileset or tilemap.</li>
<li>Hold )" SHIFT_KEY R"( and left-click a group of tiles to flood-fill it with the selected type.</li>
<li>Hold )" CONTROL_KEY R"( and left-click a tile to replace every tile of that type with the selected type.</li>
<li>Hold )" ALT_KEY R"( and left-click a tile to swap every tile of that type and every tile of the selected type.</li>
</ul>
<p>The arrow keys, or the mouse's scrolling function if it has one, will scroll the tileset or tilemap (whichever one the cursor is over). This can be done while dragging to select a rectangle of tiles, in order to select a rectangle larger than the visible area.</p>
<hr>
<p>Usually a tilemap only uses one tileset image, which starts from tile $0:00. For these you can just use the Load Tileset function ()" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(T or the toolbar's tileset button with a blue arrow). For example, pokered's gfx)" DIR_SEP "town_map.rle uses gfx" DIR_SEP R"(town_map.png.</p>
<p>Sometimes a .png tileset has redundant tiles that get eliminated when you <kbd>make</kbd> the ROM. In those cases, just load the built .1bpp, .2bpp, .4bpp, or .8bpp tileset instead. Compressed .lz files (the Pokémon GSC kind, not the GBA kind) are also supported; so are NDS .rgcn/.ncgr files.</p>
<p>Some tilemaps may also use more than one tileset. For example, pokecrystal's gfx)" DIR_SEP "pokegear" DIR_SEP "radio.tilemap.rle uses tiles from gfx" DIR_SEP "pokegear" DIR_SEP "town_map.png, gfx" DIR_SEP "pokegear" DIR_SEP "pokegear.png, and gfx" DIR_SEP "font" DIR_SEP R"(font_extra.png. For these you can use the Add Tileset function ()" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(A or the toolbar's tileset button with a green plus sign). This lets you load another tileset in addition to any you've already loaded, and can configure how it gets loaded:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Start at ID:</b> Which tile ID to begin at, instead of $0:00.</li>
<li><b>Offset:</b> Skip this many tiles from the beginning of the image.</li>
<li><b>Length:</b> Load only this many tiles from the image; 0 means to load all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, pokecrystal has this code in its <code>StatsScreen_LoadFont</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>	ld de, HPExpBarBorderGFX + 3 * LEN_1BPP_TILE
	ld hl, vTiles2 tile $76
	lb bc, BANK(HPExpBarBorderGFX), 2
	call Get1bpp_2</pre></code>
<p>To copy its effect, you would add gfx)" DIR_SEP "battle" DIR_SEP R"(hp_exp_bar_border.png with the start ID $76, offset 3, and length 2.</p>
<hr>
<p>The general-purpose GBC, GBA, SGB, SNES, Genesis, and TG16 formats all support palettes. Each tile in the tilemap has a corresponding palette ID. When you choose the Palettes tab instead of the Tiles tab, these can be viewed and edited similarly to the tiles.</p>
<p>The palette colors are arbitrary; there is no support for using or editing the actual colors displayed in-game. For some projects, the tileset image will already have the right colors; for others, it will be monochrome. You may want to make a colored-in copy of your tileset to help design tilemaps, like the example)" DIR_SEP "pokecrystal" DIR_SEP R"(town_map_pokegear.png image.</p>
<hr>
<p>)" PROGRAM_NAME R"( is mainly for editing tilemaps using tilesets that already exist, but it can also create a tilemap and tileset, and optionally a palette, from a screenshot with the Image to Tiles function ()" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(X or the toolbar's brown picture button). For example, if you want to display a custom full-screen picture, you might draw a 160x144-pixel (20x18-tile) mockup. You can then create a tilemap and tileset from that mockup, as long as it doesn't need too many unique tiles. Duplicate tiles will not be included in the tileset; this takes X/Y flipped tiles into account if the chosen format supports it.</p>
<p>The tileset image uses the current tileset width (which is 16 tiles by default). If the number of tiles in the tileset is not a multiple of 16, there will be extra blank tiles at the end of the image. Checking the option to avoid this will pick a different image size with a width that evenly divides the number of tiles, so there will be no extra tiles. (If the number of tiles is prime, this can output a tall tileset image that's one tile wide.)</p>
<p>If you enable creating a palette, you must also select a format for it. The indexed color format will embed the palette directly in the tileset image (as a PLTE chunk for PNG images, or a color table for BMP images). The assembly (RGB) format is for the .asm macros used by Gen 1 and 2 Pokémon disassemblies. The others are standard palette file formats from various graphics programs. The tileset will be grayscale if its palette is output to a separate file. Palettes are rounded from the input 8-bit RGB channels to the GBC/GBA 5-bit channels, and sorted from lightest to darkest color.</p>
<p>Creating a palette also lets you specify a color #0. Every palette will use this same color for its 0th slot, even if the color does not appear in the input image. This is useful for graphics that need a "transparent" background color, e.g. sprites. The color is specified by entering an #RRGGBB color code (or on Windows, by clicking the color preview swatch to open the standard color picker). It gets rounded down from 8-bit to 5-bit channels, like all other colors.</p>
<p>This is similar to features already provided by <a href="https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds">rgbgfx</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokeruby/tree/master/tools/gbagfx">gbagfx</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Optiroc/SuperFamiconv">superfamiconv</a>, <a href="https://www.coranac.com/man/grit/html/grit.htm">grit</a>/<a href="https://www.coranac.com/man/grit/html/wingrit.htm">WinGrit</a>, <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=6523">SnesGFX</a>, and other utilities (in fact, the palette creation algorithm is ported from superfamiconv); but Image to Tiles is oriented toward pokered and pokecrystal projects. It has options specific for their conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Format:</b> Create the tilemap in any supported format, not just a sequence of plain tile IDs.</li>
<li><b>Start at ID:</b> Start at a tile ID besides $0:00, if you plan to load the tileset somewhere else.</li>
<li><b>Blank tiles use ID:</b> Use a specified ID for blank tiles (solid color 0) instead of including that in the tileset itself. This defaults to $0:7F, the space character in Pokémon games.</li>
</ul>
